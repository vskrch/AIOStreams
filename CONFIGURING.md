This can end up overwriting the MediaFlow public IPs depending on how many users are using the instance | 
| `CACHE_STREAM_RESULTS_TTL`         | `600`                                                | The time to live (TTL) for cached stream responses in seconds. Cache that becomes older than this time is discarded |

As AIOStreams barely takes any time for its post-sorting and filtering. If all timeouts are set to 5000ms, the addon is forced to respond within 5 seconds, as all addon requests are carried out concurrently.                                       |
